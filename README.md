# It's nice to meet you!
I am Lance, and my passion for learning has led me to the world of programming 🌱

## About Me 
It was after graduating with my BSc Biology that it occurred to me that programming was an option, so here I am! 

In my spare time, you will find me playing video games and trying out all the mechanics it offers; I enjoy the mastery of knowing systems and executing them well. Let's see how I transfer this to programming!
