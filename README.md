# It's nice to meet you!
I am Lance, and my passion for learning has led me to the world of programming! 

## About Me 
It was after graduating with my BSc Biology that it occurred to me that programming was an option, so here I am! 

In my spare time, you will find me playing video games and trying out all the mechanics it offers; I enjoy the mastery of knowing systems and executing them well. Let's see how I transfer this to programming!
## Experience
* CS50: Introduction to Computer Science (_[Harvard/online](https://www.edx.org/learn/computer-science/harvard-university-cs50-s-introduction-to-computer-science)_)
* Java 17 Masterclass: Start Coding in 2024 (_[Tim Buchalka/online](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-the-complete-java-developer-course/?couponCode=SEPTSTACK24A)_)
* Leetcode (_[profile here](https://leetcode.com/u/LanCorC/)_)
## Tech Stack
* Main: Java, SQLite
* Previously dabbled in courses: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, C, Python
